1. Since my boss wants to know how many games are played in a year I counted all the games played from year 2000
2004. Every type of competition and friendly games were counted.
My boss wanted to know the top winning nations. For this I divided the number of games a team has won with the total
number of games they have played. Again all competitions and friend;y games were included.
I am trying to bet which team will win the next world cup. For this I looked at the games teams have played in the last 2 World
Cups and divided the number of games won to total number of games played in the 2014 and 2018 World Cups
2. 1) It makes it easy to compare the different values ,for example we can directly see the relative difference between
the games played in each year, when using bar charts.
  2) It makes it easy to customize what I want to show, I wanted to add a button to change the bar colors and a hover effect
  to the piechart so we can visualize the winning percentages. With d3 I have the chance to make these customizations.
  3) It makes it easy to to use different charts in the same visualizatiion, for example I chose to have a bar chart and a
  piechart to present my findings, thanks to d3 I had this option.
3. 1) Although you have less customization options using softwares like matplotlib require less code.
   2) D3 may not work with older browser versions.
   3) Compared to some other options D3 has a longer learning curve.
4. I tried to make my data visualization as accessible as possible, by choosing colors that are easy on the eyes and are friendly
for color blind people. I also added a button to change the blue bars to red if the user prefers a different color. As stated in
the "Why Accessibility is at the Heart of Visualization", there can of course be done improvements to the visualization in terms of
assistive technology. For example adding a screen reader that not only reads the texts but also describes the visuals to a visually
impaired user may close the gap between the experience different people get from viewing this visuilzation.
5. I could have added more options in terms of changing colors and maybe even the size of the texts and graphs for people who need larger
visuals or brighter colors. Although there is always room for improvement the graphs I displayed would reach the goal of
visualizing the data to my boss.
